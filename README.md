This repository contains the code used to produce results in "Genomic selection strategies to increase genetic gain in tea breeding programs" (Lubanga et al., 2022). The code was run in R 4.0.0 and AlphaSimR 1.0.4.

Note that this manuscript is currently under revision, so changes are expected.

### Contents
The repository contains two folders with scripts for 25% and 100% parent replacement. Within each folder, scripts labelled 01-06 contain the code for the burnin and the five breeding program scenarios presented in the paper. In addition, there is also a script for pedigree analysis used by script 03, as well as other scripts for post-analysis (e.g., plotting, ratio calculation, and statistical testing).
