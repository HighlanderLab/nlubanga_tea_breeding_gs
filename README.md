## Introduction

This repository contains the code used to produce results in "Genomic selection strategies to increase genetic gain in tea breeding programs" (Lubanga et al., 2023). The code was run using R 4.0.0 and AlphaSimR 1.0.4.

Note that this manuscript is currently under revision, so changes are expected.

## Contents

The repository contains two folders with scripts for 25% and 100% parent replacement. Within each folder, scripts labelled 01-06 contain the code for the burnin and the five breeding program scenarios presented in the paper. In addition, there is also a script for pedigree analysis used by script 03, as well as other scripts for post-analysis (e.g., plotting, ratio calculation, and statistical testing).
